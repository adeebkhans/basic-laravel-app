# Task Manager (Laravel)

Clear instructions to set up and run this Laravel task-manager project locally.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.1+ (or the version required by composer.json)
- Composer
- Node.js & npm
- A database (MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, etc.)

## Setup

1. Clone the repo and enter the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adeebkhans/basic-laravel-app task-manager
cd task-manager
```

2. Install PHP dependencies:

```bash
composer install
```

3. Copy the environment file and generate an app key:

```bash
copy .env.example .env    # Windows
# or
cp .env.example .env     # macOS / Linux
php artisan key:generate
```

4. Configure your database in `.env` (DB_CONNECTION, DB_DATABASE, DB_USERNAME, DB_PASSWORD).

5. Run migrations:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

## Frontend

Install JS dependencies and build assets:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev    # development
# or
npm run build  # production build
```

## Run the application

Start the local development server:

```bash
php artisan serve --host=127.0.0.1 --port=8000
or just 
php artisan serve 
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:8000 in your browser. The application redirects `/` to `/tasks`.


## Useful Commands

- Clear and cache config:

```bash
php artisan config:clear
php artisan config:cache
```

## Troubleshooting

- 404 on `/` or `/tasks`: ensure migrations have run and routes are registered (see `routes/web.php`).
- If `php artisan serve` fails on Windows, try running from PowerShell with administrator privileges or use a specific host/port as shown above.

If you need the README expanded (examples, env vars, or Docker config), tell me what you'd like added.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
